# Amazon Internet Movie Database (IMDb) Data Visualization and Analysis

In the data visualization project, we utilize the dataset of IMDb to explore and discover some creative insight into the film industry. From 2004 to 2010, the film industry was the best period in history. We found that global movie gross income first proceeds from US gross income. In other words, US movie income mainly came from outside the US market. Thus, we ask which year and month should have the highest average US gross income between 2004 and 2010.

Details:
